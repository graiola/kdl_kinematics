kdl_kinematics
==============

This library provides a class to compute the forward and inverse kinematics starting from an URDF model. The inverse kinematics is computed
using a pseudo inverse with an adaptive exponential damping.
It includes also a CLIK (closed loop inverse kinematics) solver.
The functionalities provided by this library are supposed to be real time safe.

This library provides a class to compute the forward and inverse kinematics starting from an URDF model. The inverse kinematics is computed using a pseudo inverse with an adaptive exponential damping. It includes also a CLIK (closed loop inverse kinematics) solver. The functionalities provided by this library are realized by using Eigen. The loop methods are supposed to be real time safe.
